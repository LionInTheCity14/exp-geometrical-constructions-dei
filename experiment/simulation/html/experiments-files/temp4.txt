For 4th problem

 Step 3- Select H pencil and draw the side of equilateral triangle with the given length. Label it as AB

 Step 3- Select the compass and draw arcs from points A and B with AB as the radius. 

 Step 3- Select H pencil and join the point of intersection of both the arcs with points A and B to obtain the triangle. 

 Step 3- Select the compass and bisect the angle B. 

 Step 3- Select 3H pencil and draw the line such that it passes the midpoint on the opposite side of the triangle. 

 Step 3- Select the compass and similarly bisect angle A.

 Step 3- Select 3H pencil and draw line that passes the midpoint on the opposite side of the triangle. Then, draw a line perpendicular to AB and label their point of intersection as O.

 Step 3- Select the compass and bisect angle CPB 

 Step 3-  Select 3H pencil and join the points P and M. Drop a perpendicular from M on the line PB. 

 Step 3- Select the compass, with M as the centre and MV as the radius draw a circle touching two sides of the triangle. 

 Step 3- Draw another circle with O as the centre and OM as the radius. Now, draw circles with MV as the radius, touching the two sides of the triangle and label their centres as L and M.
