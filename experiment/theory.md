### Theory

1. Geometrical construction is one of the main parts of engineering drawing which involves drawing shapes and figures with the help of a ruler and a compass. It consists of drawing and bisecting lines, creating angles, constructing different types of polygons and a lot more. 

2. A given line segment can be divided into 'n’ number of equal parts by setting the compass at any arbitrary radius and marking off arcs. It helps in locating the midpoint of line, slope of the line and has many more applications.

3. The construction of polygons helps in achieving symmetry while drawing a variety of patterns. There are miscellaneous method of drawing polygons with 'N’ number of sides.
