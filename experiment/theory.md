### Theory

1. Geometrical construction is one of the main parts of engineering drawing which involves drawing shapes and figures with the help of a ruler and a compass. It consists of drawing and bisecting lines, creating angles, constructing different types of polygons and a lot more.  

 2. A given line segment can be divided into 'n’ number of equal parts by setting the compass at any arbitrary radius and marking off arcs. It helps in locating the midpoint of line, slope of the line and has many more applications. The construction of polygons helps in achieving symmetry while drawing a variety of patterns. There are miscellaneous method of drawing polygons with 'N’ number of sides.  

3. Geometrical construction serves as the foundational framework upon which precise and accurate designs are built. Through methods such as constructing lines, angles, curves, and intersections, engineers can visually communicate intricate concepts and dimensions.  

4. In fields like engineering and architecture, constructions ensure precise representation of shapes, angles, and dimensions. This accuracy is essential for creating functional and structurally sound designs.  

5. Geometrical constructions assist in establishing symmetry and centrelines, guiding the positioning of features and ensuring balance in designs. Constructions are used to identify and mark intersection points of lines and surfaces, crucial for designing intersections, joints.
